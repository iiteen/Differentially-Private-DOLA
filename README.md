# Differentially Private Distributed Online Learning Algorithms

## Overview
Welcome to the Python implementations of algorithms from the research paper "Differentially Private Distributed Online Learning," available on IEEE Xplore. This collection of algorithms represents a significant advancement in the field of privacy-preserving machine learning.

## Algorithms
This repository includes the following algorithms:
- **ε-Differentially Private DOLA**: Ensures ε-level differential privacy for distributed online learning.
- **(ε,δ)-Differentially Private DOLA**: Provides a weaker privacy guarantee with both ε and δ parameters.
- **Sparse Private Distributed Online Learning**: Optimizes for sparsity in data representation while maintaining privacy.
- **Private DOLA Using Mini-Batches**: Implements mini-batch processing to enhance privacy and efficiency.

## Results
The `code.ipynb` notebook contains all the experimental results. Please refer to it for detailed insights and performance metrics.

## Quickstart Guide
To facilitate a smooth experience with the code, we recommend using Google Colab. Here's how to get started:

1. **Upload Project Files**:
   - open google drive and donot create and donot go inside any folder on your google drive.
   - upload the `code`, `dataset`, and `result` folders.
   - upload `code.ipynb`.


2. **Launch Google Colab**:
   - Navigate to Google Colab and open the `code.ipynb` notebook.
   - Connect to your Google Drive to colab.

3. **Execute the Code**:
   - Run all the cells in the `code.ipynb` notebook.
   - Please note that due to computational constraints, the execution may take long time.
